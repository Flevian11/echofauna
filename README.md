🌍 EchoFauna – AI-Powered Archive of Extinct Animals

EchoFauna is an immersive, interactive digital museum that blends AI, art, science, and storytelling to revive extinct species in virtual form.
This project reimagines how humans connect with extinct animals through holographic archives, 3D interactions, scroll-driven stories, and an experimental AI Lab.

⭐ Features Overview
### 1. Hero Section – Fossils to Digital Life

Dark slate cinematic intro

Floating fossil bones that assemble → glitch → become a glowing AI creature

Atmospheric soundscape (wind, heartbeat, digital hum)

CTAs: Explore the Archive | Revive with Us

Parallax-triggered transformation animation

2. About Us – Our Mission

Split-screen design:
Left → Mission text
Right → Fossil morphing into glowing digital silhouette
Message:

“We fuse art, science, and AI to digitally reconstruct extinct species — a call to protect what remains.”

3. Holographic Archive (Interactive Globe)

3D rotating Earth

Glowing extinction hotspots

Hover = species name + silhouette

Click = zoom into species preview

Tagline: “Travel across time and space. Explore the lost voices of Earth.”

4. Featured Species Carousel

AI 3D rotating models

Extinction facts

Micro soundscapes

5. Immersive Storytelling Experience

A scroll-based cinematic story:
Natural habitat → decline → extinction → AI revival.
Dynamic music shifts per stage.

6. AI Lab Playground

A futuristic console where users can:

Adjust traits (fur, size, color, habitat)

Upload prompts or sketches

Generate speculative reconstructions

7. Ecosystem Simulator

A living biome that populates with every species explored.
Gamified progress:

“You have revived X species.”

CTA: Repopulate the Archive →

8. Conservation & Action Hub

Cards for:

Modern endangered species

Donation links

Digital species adoption

Awareness messages

CTA: Take Action →

9. Community Contributions
